# Hi, I'm Gianluca

I'm a computational chemist, passionate about programming, data analysis, and artificial intelligence.


## Languages

- **Python**: scripting, scientific computing, data analysis and visualization  
- **Fortran**: my first programming language; used to write scientific computing programs  
- **C++**: experience contributing to code in the *ORCA* quantum chemistry software  


## Collaboration

I'm always happy to exchange ideas and connect with others working in computational science and not.
Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss shared interests in chemistry, scientific programming, or data-driven research.
